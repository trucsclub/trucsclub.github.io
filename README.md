# TRU Compsci Club
Hello everyone!

Please read the notes below for more context. We wanted to keep the website as simple as possible for new members to edit as easily as possible. If you have any questions check the board meeting times or you can always ask on the board chat on Discord.

For the website, we used a CSS "framework" called TailwindCSS which just makes our lives easier when it comes to CSS. For instructions on how to download and install you can check below 😃.
