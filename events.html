        <h5>7:00-8:00pm on Tuesday, November 8th, 2016</h5>
        Natural language processing (NLP) is the ability of a computer program to understand human speech as it is spoken.
        NLP is a component of artificial intelligence, so this is especially neat-o for skrubs in the Artificial Intelligence course.
        This is a talk by Dr. Stan Szpakowicz, Emeritus Professor at the University of Ottawa. He's like Gaben, but for NLP.
